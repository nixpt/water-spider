  The dejavue command surface — entry point for dejavue, the repo-local
  agent memory tool (an event log of the *why* that git can't capture:
  architectural decisions, non-obvious constraints, dead ends, handoffs).
  Use this skill when you land in a repo with a `.dejavue/` directory,
  when a task prompt mentions dejavue or "boot packet", or when you're
  about to make an architectural decision worth keeping. It names the
  CLI command surface and routes to dejavue-workflow for the full protocol.

# dejavue

Dejavue is repo-local agent memory — to project *why* what `.git/` is to
project *history*. It captures architectural decisions, non-obvious
constraints, dead ends explored, and handoffs in a portable format (JSONL +
markdown + SQLite FTS5), driven by a single-file Python CLI.

This skill is the **index** for dejavue: it names the command surface and
points at the full protocol; it doesn't restate it.

## Why this exists

Dejavue has a small but real command surface, and the recurring failure
mode is not knowing it's available — landing in a `.dejavue/`-enabled repo
and re-deriving context from git log + stale READMEs instead of running one
`dejavue context`. This skill is the "this repo has memory — use it"
reminder and the command quick-reference.

## The command surface

| Command | What |
|---|---|
| `dejavue context` | Boot packet — handoff + state + decisions + references + last 10 events + staleness warnings. Run on arrival. |
| `dejavue status` | One-liner health: agent, event count, last decision, open next-steps. |
| `dejavue start --agent <n> --goal <g>` | Mark a session start (enables `since --agent`) |
| `dejavue decision "<title>" --reason <r> --rejected "<alt>: <why>" [--supersedes <id>] [--durability {temporary,tactical,strategic,constitutional}]` | Capture an architectural decision + rejected alternatives. `--supersedes` marks an older decision as overridden; `--durability` classifies longevity. |
| `dejavue state --summary <s>` | Overwrite state.md — "what's true right now" |
| `dejavue handoff --summary <s> --next <n>` | Structured next-session brief |
| `dejavue note "<text>" --tag <t>` | Lightweight timestamped note (between annotate and decision) |
| `dejavue annotate {state,handoff,decisions} "<note>"` | Append timestamped note to a doc without rewriting it |
| `dejavue since <date\|commit\|ref..ref\|--agent>` | Temporal delta — "what changed since…". Accepts git revision ranges: `main..HEAD`, `v1.0..v2.0`. |
| `dejavue log [--since] [--agent] [--type] [--oneline]` | Formatted timeline view with filters |
| `dejavue blame <file>` | "Why does this file exist?" — decisions + events mentioning the path |
| `dejavue recall "<query>"` | FTS5 keyword (or `--semantic` cosine) search across all artifacts |
| `dejavue get {state,handoff,decisions,...}` | Direct fetch when you know what you want |
| `dejavue worthiness` | The capture/skip gate — print when unsure what to record |
| `dejavue check` | Health check — JSONL validity, hooks, .gitattributes, FTS freshness |
| `dejavue archive --before <date>` | Compact timeline (drops old file_changed, keeps decisions) |
| `dejavue roster` | Agent activity summary — who worked here and when |
| `dejavue config {list,get,set,unset}` | Manage per-repo `.dejavue/config` values |
| `dejavue install-skill [--dir]` | Install SKILL.md to `~/.claude/skills/` (or custom dir) |
| `dejavue stats` | Timeline statistics: counts by type, agent, date range |
| `dejavue export --format {json,md}` | Export full memory snapshot as JSON or Markdown |
| `dejavue export --target {claude,codex,gemini,copilot,cursor,all}` | Generate adapter file from `context.md` (DCP — non-destructive) |
| `dejavue import <FILE>` | Bootstrap `context.md` from an existing `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` |
| `dejavue promote --to planning` | Graduate `.dejavue/` into a `.planning/` planning system |
| `dejavue reference {create,list,update,view} [--type T]` | Manage `.dejavue/references/` cards |
| `dejavue diff <from> [<to>] [--format patch]` | Compare memory between two refs |
| `dejavue link <sha>` | Show dejavue events recorded for a git commit |
| `dejavue rejected [<query>]` | Show all decisions with rejected alternatives, filtered by topic. "Why wasn't X used?" answered in one command. |
| `dejavue trap "<text>"` | Record a known lie / trap — misleading name, fake abstraction, dangerous assumption agents waste time rediscovering. |
| `dejavue incident "<text>"` | Record an operational incident — outage, data corruption, failed migration. High-value memory projects routinely lose. |
| `dejavue invariant "<text>"` | Record an architectural invariant that must always hold. Appends to `invariants.md`; surfaced prominently by `context`. |
| `dejavue search "<query>"` | Alias for `recall` (same flags) |
| `dejavue init [--wizard]` | Create `.dejavue/`, install hooks (post-commit, pre-push, post-checkout), write `CLAUDE.md` boot stub. `--wizard` seeds `context.md` interactively. |
| `dejavue version` | Print the installed version |

If the CLI isn't on PATH but the repo has a copy at `dejavue.py`:

```bash
ln -sf "$(pwd)/dejavue.py" ~/.local/bin/dejavue
```

The CLI is stdlib-only Python 3 — no `pip install` needed.

## For the full protocol

[[dejavue-workflow]] is the *how*: boot-packet discipline, the capture
lifecycle, the worthiness gate, `merge=union` for parallel branches, repo
state ownership (what to track vs ignore), and when NOT to `dejavue init`.
Load it when actually working with dejavue — this index is just the map.

## What this skill does NOT cover

The how-to (that's [[dejavue-workflow]]) and the dejavue tool's own
internals / roadmap (canonical source: the project's `README.md`,
`docs/`, and `CHANGELOG.md`).
